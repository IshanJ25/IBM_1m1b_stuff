Dear Students,

Greetings from 1M1B!

I hope you have submitted your projects on the IBM mentoring platform.

IBM mentors may have already gotten in touch with a few of you on the platform. If not do not worry.

We are organising an AI ideation and mentorship workshop on 29 January, 2020, Wednesday in New Delhi for all the students whose projects have been shortlisted.

The workshop will take place at Springdales School, Pusa Road.

You are requested to be present at the venue by 9AM and the workshop will go up to 12.30PM.

Students are requested to carry their laptops for the workshop. Each project team is requested to bring along a chart paper, some post it notes and markers for this workshop.

During this workshop, AI Expert mentors from IBM will spend time with each project team and ideate on how to implement the project and the next steps students need to take towards building the prototype.

Please ensure that you have submitted the projects on the mentor platform before 26 January to attend the workshop. Projects that have not been submitted online will not be considered for mentoring.
