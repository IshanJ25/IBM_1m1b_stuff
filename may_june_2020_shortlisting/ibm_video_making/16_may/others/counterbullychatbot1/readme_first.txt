Hey there respected reader! If you are the compiler of this video then please read: (read anyways!)

the folder "stuff" contains all the finalized raw material for making the final video. We are aware that the video length should not exceed 120 secs, so you may increase the speed where CRITICALLY required.

A pdf file that contains the questions has been included for your ready reference and ease.
Video files are NOT royality free, they ALL are purely made by us using various softwares.

We at our end have tried the best to reduce the file size whilst maintaining the quality of the stuff.
All images have been renamed for your ease.
No background track has been provided, because as per your guideline, we were suppose to provide only images and clips.


Following are the provided files:
		Answers to questions asked -	"all answers.txt"			(txt file)
		Intro -				"intro.mp4"				(09 secs)
		Demo -				"watson_assistant_recording.mp4"	(21 secs)
		Body -				"main_body_video.mp4"			(85 secs)

		Outro -				"outro.mp4"				(02 secs)
		PDF we got from IBM -		"CBSE-IBM AI Program Video.pdf"		(pdf file)


However all media is to be inserted, but ATLEAST these components MUST be used in the video:
		Body -		(can be edited, if VERY important)	[priority high]

		Useful data -	(can be edited)				[priority medium]
